## Recommendations:

Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendations are proposed to reduce or manage future attrition:

Work-life balance should be a priority.

During recruitment, more attention should be paid to location as those staying closer to the facility tend to last longer in the facility.

Job satisfaction & Environment satisfaction are also major contributors to attrition, hence, more attention to be paid to them and issues addressed promptly.

Overtime, no. of shifts given should be controlled and adequately rewarded to motivate staffs and hence promote retention and better staff welfare.
